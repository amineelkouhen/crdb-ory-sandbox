This project provides a comprehensive set of *Terraform* templates to provision a joint *Ory* and *CockroachDB* proof-of-concept (PoC) environment on AWS. The goal is to demonstrate a resilient, distributed IAM architecture that combines Ory's identity stack with CockroachDB's globally consistent SQL database.

== üìã Prerequisites

- Install https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli[Terraform^]
- Ensure SSH access by creating a key pair (e.g., ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
- Obtain an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[AWS Access Key and Secret^]
- Update `variables.tf` with your AWS credentials (aws_access_key and aws_secret_key)
- For CockroachDB: obtain a valid CockroachDB License and place the key in the `cluster_license` variable (variables.tf)
- For Ory Enterprise: obtain a valid Ory Enterprise License (OEL) and place the credentials file as `credentials.json` in the `resources` directory

== ü™≥ CockroachDB - Architecture

CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database designed for horizontal scalability, high availability, and strong consistency. It stores data using a transactional key-value layer, automatically splitting and replicating ranges as data grows. This ensures resilience across failures‚Äîeven full AZ or region-level outages‚Äîwithout manual intervention.

CockroachDB scales horizontally with minimal operator overhead: At the key-value level, CockroachDB starts off with a single, empty range. As you put data in, this single range eventually reaches a threshold size. When that happens, the data splits into two ranges, each covering a contiguous segment of the entire key-value space. This process continues indefinitely; as new data flows in, existing ranges continue to split into new ranges, aiming to keep a relatively small and consistent range size.

image::images/ranges.gif[CRL]

A CockroachDB cluster consists of identical nodes deployed across multiple availability zones (AZs), offering ACID guarantees and global SQL access.

== üëÆ‚Äç Ory - Architecture

Ory provides modular, cloud-native IAM tools built for distributed systems. Key components include:

- https://www.ory.sh/kratos[Ory Kratos^] for identity management (including users, groups, and organizations),
- https://www.ory.sh/hydra[Ory Hydra^] for OAuth2 and OIDC flows,
- https://www.ory.sh/keto[Ory Keto^] for fine-grained authorization and relationship-based access control (ReBAC,  inspired by Google Zanzibar)
- https://www.ory.sh/oathkeeper[Ory Oathkeeper^] for edge authentication and request-level access control with an Identity and Access Proxy.

Each service is stateless and communicates with CockroachDB as its persistent data store.

image::images/fig1_Ory_Architecture_Overview.png[Ory]

== ü§ù Ory/CockroachDB Joint Architecture

The PoC environment integrates:

- Ory Kratos handled identity management, including user credentials, profile metadata, and sessions.
- Ory Hydra served as the OAuth2 and OIDC provider, managing token issuance, consent flows, and client registration.
- Ory Keto implemented fine-grained access control based on Google Zanzibar-inspired relationships.

Each of these components relied on CockroachDB to store their state in a consistent and durable way, enabling them to function correctly even in the presence of partial outages or regional network partitions.

Ory‚Äôs architecture is well-suited to operate with CockroachDB because of its stateless design and API-first philosophy. Each component can be deployed as a stateless service, with its only persistence requirement being the backing SQL database. This makes it straightforward to horizontally scale services, perform rolling updates, or deploy new regions without having to orchestrate complex data migrations.

CockroachDB, in turn, provides the always-consistent database layer that ensures user identities, access control rules, and session tokens are always accurate ‚Äî no matter which region is serving a request.

image::images/fig4_Ory_CockroachDB_multi_region_deployment_architecture.png[Ory-CRDB]

From a technical standpoint, identity and authorization in this system are modeled as structured entities within CockroachDB. The use of CockroachDB‚Äôs strongly consistent transactions ensures that IAM operations remain correct, even when issued concurrently from different regions or under network duress.

== üì¶ Deployment

This configuration generates a high-availability deployment for the joint sandbox within a single cloud region. This architecture is designed to protect against failures at the availability zone (AZ) level by distributing nodes of the database cluster across multiple AZs within the same region.

As illustrated in the following diagram, a single cloud region is shown containing three distinct Availability Zones: `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, and `us-east-1c`. Each Availability Zone is an isolated failure domain with its own independent power, cooling, and networking. By deploying nodes of the Ory / CRDB clusters across all three zones, the system ensures resilience against localized outages. If one AZ becomes unavailable due to a hardware or network issue, the remaining two zones continue to serve client requests without data loss or downtime.

image::main/aws/Single-Region-Multi-AZ/images/Single-Region-MAZ.svg[Single-Region Multi-AZ Configuration]

Let's start with bottom of the diagram (`CRDB VPC`): The CockroachDB nodes in each zone form a single logical cluster that replicates data across zones using the consensus protocol (typically Raft).

A regional load balancer distributes traffic across the healthy nodes in the cluster. This NLB improves performance by directing requests to the closest responsive node and provides failover capabilities by rerouting traffic away from any failed or unreachable zones.

At the top of the diagram (`Ory VPC`), Ory is deployed as a Kubernetes cluster (in EKS). The workers are created in each zone and form a single logical cluster. Each Ory component (*_Hydra_*, *_Kratos_* or *_Keto_*) is replicated as pods and distributed across the EKS cluster to provide failover capabilities and remain highly available.

This replication model ensures strong consistency ‚Äî all nodes maintain a synchronized and always-on service. Even in the event of zone-level failure, the remaining pods/nodes - for both clusters - ensures that the solution remains available and consistent.

This results in a seamless experience for end users, with low latency and high uptime.

Based on the architecture described above, we set up the infrastructure for both Ory and CockroachDB within the us-east-1 region.

1- For the CockroachDB deployment, we created a VPC in region (`us-east-1`) with three subnets, distributed across distinct Availability Zones. The CockroachDB cluster itself consists of three nodes, each deployed in a separate AZ to enable fault tolerance and quorum-based consistency. A Network Load Balancer (NLB) sits in front of the cluster to evenly route incoming requests to the appropriate database node.

2- For Ory, we provisioned a separate Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the same region (`us-east-1`), also using three subnets, each placed in a different Availability Zone to ensure high availability. An Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster was deployed with three worker nodes ‚Äî one in each AZ‚Äîto distribute the workload evenly.
For the purposes of this proof of concept, the EKS cluster is publicly accessible, and the service ports are exposed via a load balancer. All Ory components ‚Äî Hydra, Kratos, and Keto ‚Äî are configured to connect to the CockroachDB cluster through the NLB, ensuring consistent and resilient backend access.

3- Additionally, we provisioned a Bastion Host in the `us-west-2` region, located in its own VPC and subnet. This host serves as a control and testing environment, preconfigured with everything needed to simulate and interact with Ory‚Äôs components. It includes SDKs, container images, authentication credentials, and benchmarking tools to test and validate the system‚Äôs behavior under real-world scenarios.

=== üöÄ Usage Guide

Each configuration uses .tf.json files that reference Terraform modules for:

- Networking (VPCs, subnets, load balancers)
- DNS and FQDN setup
- CockroachDB clusters
- EKS (Ory) clusters
- Bastion host setup

See examples in `main/aws/Single-Region-Multi-AZ/` for AWS deployments.

=== üß™ Testing Ory Components

==== ‚úÖ Hydra (OAuth 2.0 Provider)

Ory Hydra is a server implementation of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework and the OpenID Connect Core 1.0. It tracks clients, consent requests, and tokens with strong consistency to prevent replay attacks or duplicate authorizations.

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

image::images/fig7_OAuth2_Flow.png[Hydra-flow]

The OAuth 2.0 authorization flow involving a client application, the resource owner, Ory Hydra (as the authorization server), and the resource server is structured as follows:

image::images/fig8_interaction_flow_using_Ory_Hydra.png[Hydra]

The sequence diagram depicts the interactions between four key components:

- the Client
- the Resource Owner (typically the user)
- Ory Hydra
- the Resource Server (the API or service that hosts protected resources).

The flow begins when the Client ‚Äî an application seeking access to protected resources ‚Äî initiates a request for authorization from the Resource Owner. This typically takes the form of a redirect to a login or consent screen provided by the Authorization Server (Ory Hydra). The Resource Owner reviews the request and, upon granting access, provides an authorization grant (often an authorization code) to the client.

Next, the Client uses this authorization grant to request an access token from Ory Hydra. Along with the grant, the client also authenticates itself (using credentials such as a client ID and secret). Ory Hydra validates the authorization grant and client credentials. If everything checks out, it responds by issuing an access token to the client.

Armed with the access token, the Client then makes a request to the Resource Server, presenting the token as proof of authorization. The Resource Server validates the access token ‚Äî often by introspecting it via Hydra or verifying its signature if it‚Äôs a JWT (JSON Web Token) ‚Äî and, if valid, serves the requested protected resource to the client.

This flow encapsulates the standard Authorization Code Grant pattern in OAuth 2.0, with Ory Hydra fulfilling the role of a secure, standards-compliant authorization server that manages token issuance, validation, and policy enforcement. It's designed to separate concerns between applications and services, enabling scalable and secure delegated access.

To test Ory Hydra, you can create an OAuth2 client, generate an access token, then introspect it using the following Hydra commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ hydra create oauth2-client --endpoint $HYDRA_ADMIN_URL --format json --grant-type client_credentials

==== ‚úÖ Kratos

Kratos stores user identity records, recovery flows, sessions, and login attempts in transactional tables.

Each identity can be associated with one or more credentials, stored in the identity_credentials table. These credentials define how a user authenticates with the system, such as through a password, social login, or other mechanisms.

Ory Identities implements flows that users perform themselves as opposed to administrative intervention. Facebook and Google both provide self-service registration and profile management features as you are able to make changes to your profile and sign up yourself. Ory Identities implements the following flows:

- Registration
- Login
- Logout
- User Settings
- Account Recovery
- Address Verification
- User-Facing Error
- 2FA / MFA

Let's assume the Registration flow of Kratos. The Registration Flow for API clients doesn't use HTTP Redirects and can be summarized as follows:

image::images/registration.png[registration]

To initialize the API flow, the client calls the API-flow initialization endpoint which returns a JSON response. All you need is a valid Registration Flow ID:

[source,bash]
----
$ flowId=$(curl -s -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" $KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL/self-service/registration/api | jq -r '.id')
----

Then you can submit the registration form using the following payload:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -X POST -H "Accept: application/json Content-Type: application/json" $KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL/self-service/registration?flow=$flowId -d '{
  "method": "password",
  "password": "HelloCockro@ch123",
  "traits": {
        "email": "amine.elkouhen@cockroachlabs.com",
        "name": {
            "first": "Amine M.",
            "last": "Kouhen"
        }
  }
}'

----

Ory Identities responds with a JSON payload which includes the signed up identity:

[source,json]
----
{
    "identity": {
        "id": "3ad9fe8b-ef2e-4fa4-8f3e-4b959ace03e6",
        "schema_id": "default",
        "schema_url": "http://ory-kratos-5f7474c79c-wgv9p:4434/schemas/ZGVmYXVsdA",
        "state": "active",
        "state_changed_at": "2025-06-15T22:28:38.743591684Z",
        "traits": {
            "email": "amine.elkouhen@cockroachlabs.com",
            "name": {
                "first": "Amine M.",
                "last": "Kouhen"
            }
        },
        "metadata_public": null,
        "created_at": "2025-06-15T22:28:38.747278Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-06-15T22:28:38.747278Z",
        "organization_id": null
    },
    "continue_with": null
}
----

Completing the registration, you can now start the login flow by fetching the Login Flow. All you need is a valid flow ID:

[source,bash]
----
$ flowId=$(curl -s -X GET -H  "Accept: application/json Content-Type: application/json" $KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL/self-service/login/api | jq -r '.id')
----

Then you can submit the login form using the following payload, first with a wrong password:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s -X POST -H  "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL/self-service/login?flow=$flowId \
    -d '{"identifier": "amine.elkouhen@cockroachlabs.com", "password": "the-wrong-password", "method": "password"}'
----

The server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request and the Login Flow in the response payload as JSON. You will get the following validation errors `The provided credentials are invalid, check for spelling mistakes in your password or username, email address, or phone number.`:

To logout the session, you can revoke the ory session token by calling the logout API endpoint:

$ curl -s -X DELETE -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL/self-service/logout/api -d '{
  "session_token": "ory_st_l209ZOnRSEaQRcIauchAUdFC5iYQDQld"

==== ‚úÖ Keto (Authorization Engine)

Keto provides scalable access control as relationships (ReBAC-style authorization).

In Ory Keto, authorization is checked by evaluating whether a relation tuple exists (directly or through recursive expansion) that permits a given subject to perform a relation on an object in a namespace. This data model is designed for high scalability and flexibility, enabling complex access patterns like group membership, role inheritance, and hierarchical access rights.

A permission model is a set of rules that define which relations are checked in the database during a permission check.

Permission checks are answered based on:

The data available in CockroachDB, for example: `User:Bob is owner of Document:X`

Permission rules, for example: `All owners of a document can view it`.
When you ask Keto Permissions: is `User:Bob allowed to view on Document:X`, the system checks up how Bob could have the view permission, and then checks if Bob is owner of the `document X`. The permission model tells Ory Permissions what to check in the database.

image::images/permission_graph.png[Keto]

To test Ory Keto, you can create a relation tuple using the Keto SDK:

[source,bash]
----
$ echo '{"namespace":"documents","object":"doc-123","relation":"viewer","subject_id":"user:alice"}'  | keto relation-tuple create /dev/stdin --insecure-disable-transport-security
----

or by using the Keto REST API:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -X PUT "$KETO_WRITE_REMOTE"/admin/relation-tuples \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"namespace":"documents","object":"doc-123","relation":"viewer","subject_id":"user:alice"}'
----

You can use Ory Keto's expand-API to display who has access to an object, and why:

[source,bash]
----
$ keto expand viewer documents photos --insecure-disable-transport-security
----

To assist users with managing permissions for their files, the application has to display who has access to a file and why. In this example, we assume that the application knows the following files and directories:

[source,bash]
----
‚îú‚îÄ photos            (owner: maureen; shared with laura)
   ‚îú‚îÄ beach.jpg      (owner: maureen)
   ‚îú‚îÄ mountains.jpg  (owner: laura)
----

It's important to test your permission model. To test the permissions manually, you can create relationships and check permissions through the API or SDK.

[source,bash]
----
$ keto check \"user:alice\" viewer documents /photos/beach.jpg --insecure-disable-transport-security
> allowed
----

=== ‚öôÔ∏è Terraform Execution

To initialize and deploy:

----
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

Terraform will provision two logical clusters with:

- For CockroachDB:

    * VPC and subnets (each in a distinct Availability Zone)
    * Network Load Balancers
    * 3-node CockroachDB cluster (each worker in a distinct subnet)

- For Ory:
    * VPC and subnets (each in a distinct Availability Zone)
    * 3-worker EKS cluster (each worker in a distinct subnet)
    * Ory pods are exposed as services behind Load Balancers

- A Bastion host with all requires SDKs and tools pre-installed

Sample output includes URLs and IPs for the deployed environment:
